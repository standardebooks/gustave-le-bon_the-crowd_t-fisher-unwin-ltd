			<p>The following work is devoted to an account of the
			characteristics of crowds.</p>

			<p>The whole of the common characteristics with which heredity
			endows the individuals of a race constitute the genius of the
			race.  When, however, a certain number of these individuals are
			gathered together in a crowd for purposes of action, observation
			proves that, from the mere fact of their being assembled, there
			result certain new psychological characteristics, which are added
			to the racial characteristics and differ from them at times to a
			very considerable degree.</p>

			<p>Organised crowds have always played an important part in the life
			of peoples, but this part has never been of such moment as at
			present.  The substitution of the unconscious action of crowds
			for the conscious activity of individuals is one of the principal
			characteristics of the present age.</p>

			<p>I have endeavoured to examine the difficult problem presented by
			crowds in a purely scientific manner—that is, by making an
			effort to proceed with method, and without being influenced by
			opinions, theories, and doctrines.  This, I believe, is the only
			mode of arriving at the discovery of some few particles of truth,
			especially when dealing, as is the case here, with a question
			that is the subject of impassioned controversy.  A man of science
			bent on verifying a phenomenon is not called upon to concern
			himself with the interests his verifications may hurt.  In a
			recent publication an eminent thinker, M. Goblet d'Alviela, made
			the remark that, belonging to none of the contemporary schools, I
			am occasionally found in opposition of sundry of the conclusions
			of all of them.  I hope this new work will merit a similar
			observation.  To belong to a school is necessarily to espouse its
			prejudices and preconceived opinions.</p>

			<p>Still I should explain to the reader why he will find me draw
			conclusions from my investigations which it might be thought at
			first sight they do not bear; why, for instance, after noting the
			extreme mental inferiority of crowds, picked assemblies included,
			I yet affirm it would be dangerous to meddle with their
			organisation, notwithstanding this inferiority.</p>

			<p>The reason is, that the most attentive observation of the facts
			of history has invariably demonstrated to me that social
			organisms being every whit as complicated as those of all beings,
			it is in no wise in our power to force them to undergo on a
			sudden far-reaching transformations.  Nature has recourse at
			times to radical measures, but never after our fashion, which
			explains how it is that nothing is more fatal to a people than
			the mania for great reforms, however excellent these reforms may
			appear theoretically.  They would only be useful were it possible
			to change instantaneously the genius of nations.  This power,
			however, is only possessed by time.  Men are ruled by ideas,
			sentiments, and customs—matters which are of the essence of
			ourselves.  Institutions and laws are the outward manifestation
			of our character, the expression of its needs.  Being its
			outcome, institutions and laws cannot change this character.</p>

			<p>The study of social phenomena cannot be separated from that of
			the peoples among whom they have come into existence.  From the
			philosophic point of view these phenomena may have an absolute
			value; in practice they have only a relative value.</p>

			<p>It is necessary, in consequence, when studying a social
			phenomenon, to consider it successively under two very different
			aspects.  It will then be seen that the teachings of pure reason
			are very often contrary to those of practical reason.  There are
			scarcely any data, even physical, to which this distinction is
			not applicable.  From the point of view of absolute truth a cube
			or a circle are invariable geometrical figures, rigorously
			defined by certain formulas.  From the point of view of the
			impression they make on our eye these geometrical figures may
			assume very varied shapes.  By perspective the cube may be
			transformed into a pyramid or a square, the circle into an
			ellipse or a straight line.  Moreover, the consideration of these
			fictitious shapes is far more important than that of the real
			shapes, for it is they and they alone that we see and that can be
			reproduced by photography or in pictures.  In certain cases there
			is more truth in the unreal than in the real.  To present objects
			with their exact geometrical forms would be to distort nature and
			render it unrecognisable.  If we imagine a world whose
			inhabitants could only copy or photograph objects, but were
			unable to touch them, it would be very difficult for such persons
			to attain to an exact idea of their form.  Moreover, the
			knowledge of this form, accessible only to a small number of
			learned men, would present but a very minor interest.</p>

			<p>The philosopher who studies social phenomena should bear in mind
			that side by side with their theoretical value they possess a
			practical value, and that this latter, so far as the evolution of
			civilisation is concerned, is alone of importance.  The
			recognition of this fact should render him very circumspect with
			regard to the conclusions that logic would seem at first to
			enforce upon him.</p>

			<p>There are other motives that dictate to him a like reserve.  The
			complexity of social facts is such, that it is impossible to
			grasp them as a whole and to foresee the effects of their
			reciprocal influence.  It seems, too, that behind the visible
			facts are hidden at times thousands of invisible causes.  Visible
			social phenomena appear to be the result of an immense,
			unconscious working, that as a rule is beyond the reach of our
			analysis.  Perceptible phenomena may be compared to the waves,
			which are the expression on the surface of the ocean of
			deep-lying disturbances of which we know nothing.  So far as the
			majority of their acts are considered, crowds display a
			singularly inferior mentality; yet there are other acts in which
			they appear to be guided by those mysterious forces which the
			ancients denominated destiny, nature, or providence, which we
			call the voices of the dead, and whose power it is impossible to
			overlook, although we ignore their essence.  It would seem, at
			times, as if there were latent forces in the inner being of
			nations which serve to guide them.  What, for instance, can be
			more complicated, more logical, more marvellous than a language?
			Yet whence can this admirably organised production have arisen,
			except it be the outcome of the unconscious genius of crowds?
			The most learned academics, the most esteemed grammarians can do
			no more than note down the laws that govern languages; they would
			be utterly incapable of creating them.  Even with respect to the
			ideas of great men are we certain that they are exclusively the
			offspring of their brains?  No doubt such ideas are always
			created by solitary minds, but is it not the genius of crowds
			that has furnished the thousands of grains of dust forming the
			soil in which they have sprung up?</p>

			<p>Crowds, doubtless, are always unconscious, but this very
			unconsciousness is perhaps one of the secrets of their strength.
			In the natural world beings exclusively governed by instinct
			accomplish acts whose marvellous complexity astounds us.  Reason
			is an attribute of humanity of too recent date and still too
			imperfect to reveal to us the laws of the unconscious, and still
			more to take its place.  The part played by the unconscious in
			all our acts is immense, and that played by reason very small.
			The unconscious acts like a force still unknown.</p>

			<p>If we wish, then, to remain within the narrow but safe limits
			within which science can attain to knowledge, and not to wander
			in the domain of vague conjecture and vain hypothesis, all we
			must do is simply to take note of such phenomena as are
			accessible to us, and confine ourselves to their consideration.
			Every conclusion drawn from our observation is, as a rule,
			premature, for behind the phenomena which we see clearly are
			other phenomena that we see indistinctly, and perhaps behind
			these latter, yet others which we do not see at all.</p>
