<p>Preparatory factors of the beliefs of crowds—The origin of the
beliefs of crowds is the consequence of a preliminary process of
elaboration— Study of the different factors of these beliefs.
1. RACE. The predominating influence it exercises—It
represents the suggestions of ancestors.   2. TRADITIONS.
They are the synthesis of the soul of the race—Social importance
of traditions—How, after having been necessary they become
harmful—Crowds are the most obstinate maintainers of traditional
ideas.   3. TIME. It prepares in succession the establishment
of beliefs and then their destruction.  It is by the aid of this
factor that order may proceed from chaos.   4. POLITICAL AND
SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS. Erroneous idea of their part—Their
influence extremely weak—They are effects, not causes—Nations
are incapable of choosing what appear to them the best
institutions—Institutions are labels which shelter the most
dissimilar things under the same title— How institutions may
come to be created—Certain institutions theoretically bad, such
as centralisation obligatory for certain nations.   5.
INSTITUTIONS AND EDUCATION. Falsity of prevalent ideas as to the
influence of instruction on crowds— Statistical
indications—Demoralising effect of Latin system of
education—Part instruction might play—Examples furnished by
various peoples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">Having studied the mental constitution of crowds and become
acquainted with their modes of feeling, thinking, and reasoning,
we shall now proceed to examine how their opinions and beliefs
arise and become established.</p>

<p>The factors which determine these opinions and beliefs are of two
kinds: remote factors and immediate factors.</p>

<p>The remote factors are those which render crowds capable of
adopting certain convictions and absolutely refractory to the
acceptance of others.  These factors prepare the ground in which
are suddenly seen to germinate certain new ideas whose force and
consequences are a cause of astonishment, though they are only
spontaneous in appearance.  The outburst and putting in practice
of certain ideas among crowds present at times a startling
suddenness.  This is only a superficial effect, behind which must
be sought a preliminary and preparatory action of long duration.</p>

<p>The immediate factors are those which, coming on the top of this
long, preparatory working, in whose absence they would remain
without effect, serve as the source of active persuasion on
crowds; that is, they are the factors which cause the idea to
take shape and set it loose with all its consequences.  The
resolutions by which collectivities are suddenly carried away
arise out of these immediate factors; it is due to them that a
riot breaks out or a strike is decided upon, and to them that
enormous majorities invest one man with power to overthrow a
government.</p>

<p>The successive action of these two kinds of factors is to be
traced in all great historical events.  The French Revolution—to
cite but one of the most striking of such events—had among its
remote factors the writings of the philosophers, the exactions of
the nobility, and the progress of scientific thought.  The mind
of the masses, thus prepared, was then easily roused by such
immediate factors as the speeches of orators, and the resistance
of the court party to insignificant reforms.</p>

<p>Among the remote factors there are some of a general nature,
which are found to underlie all the beliefs and opinions of
crowds.  They are race, traditions, time, institutions, and
education.</p>

<p>We now proceed to study the influence of these different factors.</p>

<h5>1. RACE</h5>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">This factor, race, must be placed in the first rank, for in
itself it far surpasses in importance all the others.  We have
sufficiently studied it in another work; it is therefore needless
to deal with it again.  We showed, in a previous volume, what an
historical race is, and how, its character once formed, it
possesses, as the result of the laws of heredity such power that
its beliefs, institutions, and arts—in a word, all the elements
of its civilisation—are merely the outward expression of its
genius.  We showed that the power of the race is such that no
element can pass from one people to another without undergoing
the most profound transformations.[7]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">[7] The novelty of this proposition being still considerable and
history being quite unintelligible without it, I devoted four
chapters to its demonstration in my last book ("The Psychological
Laws of the Evolution of Peoples").  From it the reader will see
that, in spite of fallacious appearances, neither language,
religion, arts, or, in a word, any element of civilisation, can
pass, intact, from one people to another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em">Environment, circumstances, and events represent the social
suggestions of the moment.  They may have a considerable
influence, but this influence is always momentary if it be
contrary to the suggestions of the race; that is, to those which
are inherited by a nation from the entire series of its
ancestors.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion in several of the chapters of this work to
touch again upon racial influence, and to show that this
influence is so great that it dominates the characteristics
peculiar to the genius of crowds.  It follows from this fact that
the crowds of different countries offer very considerable
differences of beliefs and conduct and are not to be influenced
in the same manner.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2em">2. TRADITIONS</h4>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">Traditions represent the ideas, the needs, and the sentiments of
the past.  They are the synthesis of the race, and weigh upon us
with immense force.</p>

<p>The biological sciences have been transformed since embryology
has shown the immense influence of the past on the evolution of
living beings; and the historical sciences will not undergo a
less change when this conception has become more widespread.  As
yet it is not sufficiently general, and many statesmen are still
no further advanced than the theorists of the last century, who
believed that a society could break off with its past and be
entirely recast on lines suggested solely by the light of reason.</p>

<p>A people is an organism created by the past, and, like every
other organism, it can only be modified by slow hereditary
accumulations.</p>

<p>It is tradition that guides men, and more especially so when they
are in a crowd.  The changes they can effect in their traditions
with any ease, merely bear, as I have often repeated, upon names
and outward forms.</p>

<p>This circumstance is not to be regretted.  Neither a national
genius nor civilisation would be possible without traditions.  In
consequence man's two great concerns since he has existed have
been to create a network of traditions which he afterwards
endeavours to destroy when their beneficial effects have worn
themselves out.  Civilisation is impossible without traditions,
and progress impossible without the destruction of those
traditions.  The difficulty, and it is an immense difficulty, is
to find a proper equilibrium between stability and variability.
Should a people allow its customs to become too firmly rooted, it
can no longer change, and becomes, like China, incapable of
improvement.  Violent revolutions are in this case of no avail;
for what happens is that either the broken fragments of the chain
are pieced together again and the past resumes its empire without
change, or the fragments remain apart and decadence soon succeeds
anarchy.</p>

<p>The ideal for a people is in consequence to preserve the
institutions of the past, merely changing them insensibly and
little by little.  This ideal is difficult to realise.  The
Romans in ancient and the English in modern times are almost
alone in having realised it.</p>

<p>It is precisely crowds that cling the most tenaciously to
traditional ideas and oppose their being changed with the most
obstinacy.  This is notably the case with the category of crowds
constituting castes.  I have already insisted upon the
conservative spirit of crowds, and shown that the most violent
rebellions merely end in a changing of words and terms.  At the
end of the last century, in the presence of destroyed churches,
of priests expelled the country or guillotined, it might have
been thought that the old religious ideas had lost all their
strength, and yet a few years had barely lapsed before the
abolished system of public worship had to be re-established in
deference to universal demands.[8]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">[8] The report of the ex-Conventionist, Fourcroy, quoted by
Taine, is very clear on this point.</p>

<p>"What is everywhere seen with respect to the keeping of Sunday
and attendance at the churches proves that the majority of
Frenchmen desire to return to their old usages and that it is no
longer opportune to resist this natural tendency. . . .  The
great majority of men stand in need of religion, public worship,
and priests.  IT IS AN ERROR OF SOME MODERN PHILOSOPHERS, BY
WHICH I MYSELF HAVE BEEN LED AWAY, to believe in the possibility
of instruction being so general as to destroy religious
prejudices, which for a great number of unfortunate persons are a
source of consolation. . . .  The mass of the people, then, must
be allowed its priests, its altars, and its public worship."</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em">Blotted out for a moment, the old traditions had resumed their
sway.</p>

<p>No example could better display the power of tradition on the
mind of crowds.  The most redoubtable idols do not dwell in
temples, nor the most despotic tyrants in palaces; both the one
and the other can be broken in an instant.  But the invisible
masters that reign in our innermost selves are safe from every
effort at revolt, and only yield to the slow wearing away of
centuries.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2em">3. TIME</h4>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">In social as in biological problems time is one of the most
energetic factors.  It is the sole real creator and the sole
great destroyer.  It is time that has made mountains with grains
of sand and raised the obscure cell of geological eras to human
dignity.  The action of centuries is sufficient to transform any
given phenomenon.  It has been justly observed that an ant with
enough time at its disposal could level Mount Blanc.  A being
possessed of the magical force of varying time at his will would
have the power attributed by believers to God.</p>

<p>In this place, however, we have only to concern ourselves with
the influence of time on the genesis of the opinions of crowds.
Its action from this point of view is still immense.  Dependent
upon it are the great forces such as race, which cannot form
themselves without it.  It causes the birth, the growth, and the
death of all beliefs.  It is by the aid of time that they acquire
their strength and also by its aid that they lose it.</p>

<p>It is time in particular that prepares the opinions and beliefs
of crowds, or at least the soil on which they will germinate.
This is why certain ideas are realisable at one epoch and not at
another.  It is time that accumulates that immense detritus of
beliefs and thoughts on which the ideas of a given period spring
up.  They do not grow at hazard and by chance; the roots of each
of them strike down into a long past.  When they blossom it is
time that has prepared their blooming; and to arrive at a notion
of their genesis it is always back in the past that it is
necessary to search.  They are the daughters of the past and the
mothers of the future, but throughout the slaves of time.</p>

<p>Time, in consequence, is our veritable master, and it suffices to
leave it free to act to see all things transformed.  At the
present day we are very uneasy with regard to the threatening
aspirations of the masses and the destructions and upheavals
foreboded thereby.  Time, without other aid, will see to the
restoration of equilibrium.  "No form of government," M. Lavisse
very properly writes, "was founded in a day.  Political and
social organisations are works that demand centuries.  The feudal
system existed for centuries in a shapeless, chaotic state before
it found its laws; absolute monarchy also existed for centuries
before arriving at regular methods of government, and these
periods of expectancy were extremely troubled."</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2em">4. POLITICAL AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS</h4>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">The idea that institutions can remedy the defects of societies,
that national progress is the consequence of the improvement of
institutions and governments, and that social changes can be
effected by decrees— this idea, I say, is still generally
accepted.  It was the starting-point of the French Revolution,
and the social theories of the present day are based upon it.</p>

<p>The most continuous experience has been unsuccessful in shaking
this grave delusion.  Philosophers and historians have
endeavoured in vain to prove its absurdity, but yet they have had
no difficulty in demonstrating that institutions are the outcome
of ideas, sentiments, and customs, and that ideas, sentiments,
and customs are not to be recast by recasting legislative codes.
A nation does not choose its institutions at will any more than
it chooses the colour of its hair or its eyes.  Institutions and
governments are the product of the race.  They are not the
creators of an epoch, but are created by it.  Peoples are not
governed in accordance with their caprices of the moment, but as
their character determines that they shall be governed.
Centuries are required to form a political system and centuries
needed to change it.  Institutions have no intrinsic virtue: in
themselves they are neither good nor bad.  Those which are good
at a given moment for a given people may be harmful in the
extreme for another nation.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is in no way in the power of a people to really
change its institutions.  Undoubtedly, at the cost of violent
revolutions, it can change their name, but in their essence they
remain unmodified.  The names are mere futile labels with which
an historian who goes to the bottom of things need scarcely
concern himself.  It is in this way, for instance, that
England,[9] the most democratic country in the world, lives,
nevertheless, under a monarchical regime, whereas the countries
in which the most oppressive despotism is rampant are the
Spanish-American Republics, in spite of their republican
constitutions.  The destinies of peoples are determined by their
character and not by their government.  I have endeavoured to
establish this view in my previous volume by setting forth
categorical examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">[9] The most advanced republicans, even of the United States,
recognise this fact.  The American magazine, The Forum, recently
gave categorical expression to the opinion in terms which I
reproduce here from the Review of Reviews for December, 1894:—</p>

<p>"It should never be forgotten, even by the most ardent enemies of
an aristocracy, that England is to-day the most democratic
country of the universe, the country in which the rights of the
individual are most respected, and in which the individual
possesses the most liberty."</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em">To lose time in the manufacture of cut-and-dried constitutions
is, in consequence, a puerile task, the useless labour of an
ignorant rhetorician.  Necessity and time undertake the charge of
elaborating constitutions when we are wise enough to allow these
two factors to act.  This is the plan the Anglo-Saxons have
adopted, as their great historian, Macaulay, teaches us in a
passage that the politicians of all Latin countries ought to
learn by heart.  After having shown all the good that can be
accomplished by laws which appear from the point of view of pure
reason a chaos of absurdities and contradictions, he compares the
scores of constitutions that have been engulfed in the
convulsions of the Latin peoples with that of England, and points
out that the latter has only been very slowly changed part by
part, under the influence of immediate necessities and never of
speculative reasoning.</p>

<p>"To think nothing of symmetry and much of convenience; never to
remove an anomaly merely because it is an anomaly; never to
innovate except when some grievance is felt; never to innovate
except so far as to get rid of the grievance; never to lay down
any proposition of wider extent than the particular case for
which it is necessary to provide; these are the rules which have,
from the age of John to the age of Victoria, generally guided the
deliberations of our two hundred and fifty Parliaments."</p>

<p>It would be necessary to take one by one the laws and
institutions of each people to show to what extent they are the
expression of the needs of each race and are incapable, for that
reason, of being violently transformed.  It is possible, for,
instance, to indulge in philosophical dissertations on the
advantages and disadvantages of centralisation; but when we see a
people composed of very different races devote a thousand years
of efforts to attaining to this centralisation; when we observe
that a great revolution, having for object the destruction of all
the institutions of the past, has been forced to respect this
centralisation, and has even strengthened it; under these
circumstances we should admit that it is the outcome of imperious
needs, that it is a condition of the existence of the nation in
question, and we should pity the poor mental range of politicians
who talk of destroying it.  Could they by chance succeed in this
attempt, their success would at once be the signal for a
frightful civil war,[10] which, moreover, would immediately bring
back a new system of centralisation much more oppressive than the
old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">[10] If a comparison be made between the profound religious and
political dissensions which separate the various parties in
France, and are more especially the result of social questions,
and the separatist tendencies which were manifested at the time
of the Revolution, and began to again display themselves towards
the close of the Franco-German war, it will be seen that the
different races represented in France are still far from being
completely blended.  The vigorous centralisation of the
Revolution and the creation of artificial departments destined to
bring about the fusion of the ancient provinces was certainly its
most useful work.  Were it possible to bring about the
decentralisation which is to-day preoccupying minds lacking in
foresight, the achievement would promptly have for consequence
the most sanguinary disorders.  To overlook this fact is to leave
out of account the entire history of France.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em">The conclusion to be drawn from what precedes is, that it is not
in institutions that the means is to be sought of profoundly
influencing the genius of the masses.  When we see certain
countries, such as the United States, reach a high degree of
prosperity under democratic institutions, while others, such as
the Spanish-American Republics, are found existing in a pitiable
state of anarchy under absolutely similar institutions, we should
admit that these institutions are as foreign to the greatness of
the one as to the decadence of the others.  Peoples are governed
by their character, and all institutions which are not intimately
modelled on that character merely represent a borrowed garment, a
transitory disguise.  No doubt sanguinary wars and violent
revolutions have been undertaken, and will continue to be
undertaken, to impose institutions to which is attributed, as to
the relics of saints, the supernatural power of creating welfare.
It may be said, then, in one sense, that institutions react on
the mind of the crowd inasmuch as they engender such upheavals.
But in reality it is not the institutions that react in this
manner, since we know that, whether triumphant or vanquished,
they possess in themselves no virtue.  It is illusions and words
that have influenced the mind of the crowd, and especially
words— words which are as powerful as they are chimerical, and
whose astonishing sway we shall shortly demonstrate.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2em">5. INSTRUCTION AND EDUCATION</h4>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">Foremost among the dominant ideas of the present epoch is to be
found the notion that instruction is capable of considerably
changing men, and has for its unfailing consequence to improve
them and even to make them equal.  By the mere fact of its being
constantly repeated, this assertion has ended by becoming one of
the most steadfast democratic dogmas.  It would be as difficult
now to attack it as it would have been formerly to have attacked
the dogmas of the Church.</p>

<p>On this point, however, as on many others, democratic ideas are
in profound disagreement with the results of psychology and
experience.  Many eminent philosophers, among them Herbert
Spencer, have had no difficulty in showing that instruction
neither renders a man more moral nor happier, that it changes
neither his instincts nor his hereditary passions, and that at
times—for this to happen it need only be badly directed—it is
much more pernicious than useful.  Statisticians have brought
confirmation of these views by telling us that criminality
increases with the generalisation of instruction, or at any rate
of a certain kind of instruction, and that the worst enemies of
society, the anarchists, are recruited among the prize-winners of
schools; while in a recent work a distinguished magistrate, M.
Adolphe Guillot, made the observation that at present 3,000
educated criminals are met with for every 1,000 illiterate
delinquents, and that in fifty years the criminal percentage of
the population has passed from 227 to 552 for every 100,000
inhabitants, an increase of 133 per cent.  He has also noted in
common with his colleagues that criminality is particularly on
the increase among young persons, for whom, as is known,
gratuitous and obligatory schooling has—in France—replaced
apprenticeship.</p>

<p>It is not assuredly—and nobody has ever maintained this
proposition— that well-directed instruction may not give very
useful practical results, if not in the sense of raising the
standard of morality, at least in that of developing professional
capacity.  Unfortunately the Latin peoples, especially in the
last twenty-five years, have based their systems of instruction
on very erroneous principles, and in spite of the observations of
the most eminent minds, such as Breal, Fustel de Coulanges,
Taine, and many others, they persist in their lamentable
mistakes.  I have myself shown, in a work published some time
ago, that the French system of education transforms the majority
of those who have undergone it into enemies of society, and
recruits numerous disciples for the worst forms of socialism.</p>

<p>The primary danger of this system of education—very properly
qualified as Latin—consists in the fact that it is based on the
fundamental psychological error that the intelligence is
developed by the learning by heart of text-books.  Adopting this
view, the endeavour has been made to enforce a knowledge of as
many hand-books as possible.  From the primary school till he
leaves the university a young man does nothing but acquire books
by heart without his judgment or personal initiative being ever
called into play.  Education consists for him in reciting by
heart and obeying.</p>

<p>"Learning lessons, knowing by heart a grammar or a compendium,
repeating well and imitating well—that," writes a former
Minister of Public Instruction, M. Jules Simon, "is a ludicrous
form of education whose every effort is an act of faith tacitly
admitting the infallibility of the master, and whose only results
are a belittling of ourselves and a rendering of us impotent."</p>

<p>Were this education merely useless, one might confine one's self
to expressing compassion for the unhappy children who, instead of
making needful studies at the primary school, are instructed in
the genealogy of the sons of Clotaire, the conflicts between
Neustria and Austrasia, or zoological classifications.  But the
system presents a far more serious danger.  It gives those who
have been submitted to it a violent dislike to the state of life
in which they were born, and an intense desire to escape from it.
The working man no longer wishes to remain a working man, or the
peasant to continue a peasant, while the most humble members of
the middle classes admit of no possible career for their sons
except that of State-paid functionaries.  Instead of preparing
men for life French schools solely prepare them to occupy public
functions, in which success can be attained without any necessity
for self-direction or the exhibition of the least glimmer of
personal initiative.  At the bottom of the social ladder the
system creates an army of proletarians discontented with their
lot and always ready to revolt, while at the summit it brings
into being a frivolous bourgeoisie, at once sceptical and
credulous, having a superstitious confidence in the State, whom
it regards as a sort of Providence, but without forgetting to
display towards it a ceaseless hostility, always laying its own
faults to the door of the Government, and incapable of the least
enterprise without the intervention of the authorities.</p>

<p>The State, which manufactures by dint of textbooks all these
persons possessing diplomas, can only utilise a small number of
them, and is forced to leave the others without employment.  It
is obliged in consequence to resign itself to feeding the first
mentioned and to having the others as its enemies.  From the top
to the bottom of the social pyramid, from the humblest clerk to
the professor and the prefect, the immense mass of persons
boasting diplomas besiege the professions.  While a business man
has the greatest difficulty in finding an agent to represent him
in the colonies, thousands of candidates solicit the most modest
official posts.  There are 20,000 schoolmasters and mistresses
without employment in the department of the Seine alone, all of
them persons who, disdaining the fields or the workshops, look to
the State for their livelihood.  The number of the chosen being
restricted, that of the discontented is perforce immense.  The
latter are ready for any revolution, whoever be its chiefs and
whatever the goal they aim at.  The acquisition of knowledge for
which no use can be found is a sure method of driving a man to
revolt.[11]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">[11] This phenomenon, moreover, is not peculiar to the Latin
peoples.  It is also to be observed in China, which is also a
country in the hands of a solid hierarchy of mandarins or
functionaries, and where a function is obtained, as in France, by
competitive examination, in which the only test is the
imperturbable recitation of bulky manuals.  The army of educated
persons without employment is considered in China at the present
day as a veritable national calamity.  It is the same in India
where, since the English have opened schools, not for educating
purposes, as is the case in England itself, but simply to furnish
the indigenous inhabitants with instruction, there has been
formed a special class of educated persons, the Baboos, who, when
they do not obtain employment, become the irreconcilable enemies
of the English rule.  In the case of all the Baboos, whether
provided with employment or not, the first effect of their
instruction has been to lower their standard of morality.  This
is a fact on which I have insisted at length in my book, "The
Civilisations of India"—a fact, too, which has been observed by
all authors who have visited the great peninsula.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em">It is evidently too late to retrace our steps.  Experience alone,
that supreme educator of peoples, will be at pains to show us our
mistake.  It alone will be powerful enough to prove the necessity
of replacing our odious text-books and our pitiable examinations
by industrial instruction capable of inducing our young men to
return to the fields, to the workshop, and to the colonial
enterprise which they avoid to-day at all costs.</p>

<p>The professional instruction which all enlightened minds are now
demanding was the instruction received in the past by our
forefathers.  It is still in vigour at the present day among the
nations who rule the world by their force of will, their
initiative, and their spirit of enterprise.  In a series of
remarkable pages, whose principal passages I reproduce further
on, a great thinker, M. Taine, has clearly shown that our former
system of education was approximately that in vogue to-day in
England and America, and in a remarkable parallel between the
Latin and Anglo-Saxon systems he has plainly pointed out the
consequences of the two methods.</p>

<p>One might consent, perhaps, at a pinch, to continue to accept all
the disadvantages of our classical education, although it
produced nothing but discontented men, and men unfitted for their
station in life, did the superficial acquisition of so much
knowledge, the faultless repeating by heart of so many
text-books, raise the level of intelligence.  But does it really
raise this level?  Alas, no!  The conditions of success in life
are the possession of judgment, experience, initiative, and
character—qualities which are not bestowed by books.  Books are
dictionaries, which it is useful to consult, but of which it is
perfectly useless to have lengthy portions in one's head.</p>

<p>How is it possible for professional instruction to develop the
intelligence in a measure quite beyond the reach of classical
instruction?  This has been well shown by M. Taine.</p>

<p>"Ideas, he says, are only formed in their natural and normal
surroundings; the promotion of the growth is effected by the
innumerable impressions appealing to the senses which a young man
receives daily in the workshop, the mine, the law court, the
study, the builder's yard, the hospital; at the sight of tools,
materials, and operations; in the presence of customers, workers,
and labour, of work well or ill done, costly or lucrative.  In
such a way are obtained those trifling perceptions of detail of
the eyes, the ear, the hands, and even the sense of smell, which,
picked up involuntarily, and silently elaborated, take shape
within the learner, and suggest to him sooner or, later this or
that new combination, simplification, economy, improvement, or
invention.  The young Frenchman is deprived, and precisely at the
age when they are most fruitful, of all these precious contacts,
of all these indispensable elements of assimilation.  For seven
or eight years on end he is shut up in a school, and is cut off
from that direct personal experience which would give him a keen
and exact notion of men and things and of the various ways of
handling them."</p>

<p>" . . . At least nine out of ten have wasted their time and pains
during several years of their life—telling, important, even
decisive years.  Among such are to be counted, first of all, the
half or two-thirds of those who present themselves for
examination—I refer to those who are rejected; and then among
those who are successful, who obtain a degree, a certificate, a
diploma, there is still a half or two-thirds—I refer to the
overworked.  Too much has been demanded of them by exacting that
on a given day, on a chair or before a board, they should, for
two hours in succession, and with respect to a group of sciences,
be living repertories of all human knowledge.  In point of fact
they were that, or nearly so, for two hours on that particular
day, but a month later they are so no longer.  They could not go
through the examination again.  Their too numerous and too
burdensome acquisitions slip incessantly from their mind, and are
not replaced.  Their mental vigour has declined, their fertile
capacity for growth has dried up, the fully-developed man
appears, and he is often a used-up man.  Settled down, married,
resigned to turning in a circle, and indefinitely in the same
circle, he shuts himself up in his confined function, which he
fulfils adequately, but nothing more.  Such is the average yield:
assuredly the receipts do not balance the expenditure.  In
England or America, where, as in France previous to 1789, the
contrary proceeding is adopted, the outcome obtained is equal or
superior."</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">The illustrious psychologist subsequently shows us the difference
between our system and that of the Anglo-Saxons.  The latter do
not possess our innumerable special schools.  With them
instruction is not based on book-learning, but on object lessons.
The engineer, for example, is trained in a workshop, and never at
a school; a method which allows of each individual reaching the
level his intelligence permits of.  He becomes a workman or a
foreman if he can get no further, an engineer if his aptitudes
take him as far.  This manner of proceeding is much more
democratic and of much greater benefit to society than that of
making the whole career of an individual depend on an
examination, lasting a few hours, and undergone at the age of
nineteen or twenty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">"In the hospital, the mine, the factory, in the architect's or
the lawyer's office, the student, who makes a start while very
young, goes through his apprenticeship, stage by stage, much as
does with us a law clerk in his office, or an artist in his
studio.  Previously, and before making a practical beginning, he
has had an opportunity of following some general and summary
course of instruction, so as to have a framework ready prepared
in which to store the observations he is shortly to make.
Furthermore he is able, as a rule, to avail himself of sundry
technical courses which he can follow in his leisure hours, so as
to co-ordinate step by step the daily experience he is gathering.
Under such a system the practical capabilities increase and
develop of themselves in exact proportion to the faculties of the
student, and in the direction requisite for his future task and
the special work for which from now onwards he desires to fit
himself.  By this means in England or the United States a young
man is quickly in a position to develop his capacity to the
utmost.  At twenty-five years of age, and much sooner if the
material and the parts are there, he is not merely a useful
performer, he is capable also of spontaneous enterprise; he is
not only a part of a machine, but also a motor.  In France, where
the contrary system prevails—in France, which with each
succeeding generation is falling more and more into line with
China—the sum total of the wasted forces is enormous."</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">The great philosopher arrives at the following conclusion with
respect to the growing incongruity between our Latin system of
education and the requirements of practical life:—</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">"In the three stages of instruction, those of childhood,
adolescence and youth, the theoretical and pedagogic preparation
by books on the school benches has lengthened out and become
overcharged in view of the examination, the degree, the diploma,
and the certificate, and solely in this view, and by the worst
methods, by the application of an unnatural and anti-social
regime, by the excessive postponement of the practical
apprenticeship, by our boarding-school system, by artificial
training and mechanical cramming, by overwork, without thought
for the time that is to follow, for the adult age and the
functions of the man, without regard for the real world on which
the young man will shortly be thrown, for the society in which we
move and to which he must be adapted or be taught to resign
himself in advance, for the struggle in which humanity is
engaged, and in which to defend himself and to keep his footing
he ought previously to have been equipped, armed, trained, and
hardened.  This indispensable equipment, this acquisition of more
importance than any other, this sturdy common sense and nerve and
will-power our schools do not procure the young Frenchman; on the
contrary, far from qualifying him for his approaching and
definite state, they disqualify him.  In consequence, his entry
into the world and his first steps in the field of action are
most often merely a succession of painful falls, whose effect is
that he long remains wounded and bruised, and sometimes disabled
for life.  The test is severe and dangerous.  In the course of it
the mental and moral equilibrium is affected, and runs the risk
of not being re-established.  Too sudden and complete disillusion
has supervened.  The deceptions have been too great, the
disappointments too keen."[12]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">[12] Taine, "Le Regime moderne," vol. ii., 1894.  These pages are
almost the last that Taine wrote.  They resume admirably the
results of the great philosopher's long experience.
Unfortunately they are in my opinion totally incomprehensible for
such of our university professors who have not lived abroad.
Education is the only means at our disposal of influencing to
some extent the mind of a nation, and it is profoundly saddening
to have to think that there is scarcely any one in France who can
arrive at understanding that our present system of teaching is a
grave cause of rapid decadence, which instead of elevating our
youth, lowers and perverts it.</p>

<p>A useful comparison may be made between Taine's pages and the
observations on American education recently made by M. Paul
Bourget in his excellent book, "Outre-Mer."  He, too, after
having noted that our education merely produces narrow-minded
bourgeois, lacking in initiative and will-power, or
anarchists—"those two equally harmful types of the civilised
man, who degenerates into impotent platitude or insane
destructiveness"—he too, I say, draws a comparison that cannot
be the object of too much reflection between our French lycees
(public schools), those factories of degeneration, and the
American schools, which prepare a man admirably for life.  The
gulf existing between truly democratic nations and those who have
democracy in their speeches, but in no wise in their thoughts, is
clearly brought out in this comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em">Have we digressed in what precedes from the psychology of crowds?
Assuredly not.  If we desire to understand the ideas and beliefs
that are germinating to-day in the masses, and will spring up
to-morrow, it is necessary to know how the ground has been
prepared.  The instruction given the youth of a country allows of
a knowledge of what that country will one day be.  The education
accorded the present generation justifies the most gloomy
previsions.  It is in part by instruction and education that the
mind of the masses is improved or deteriorated.  It was necessary
in consequence to show how this mind has been fashioned by the
system in vogue, and how the mass of the indifferent and the
neutral has become progressively an army of the discontented
ready to obey all the suggestions of utopians and rhetoricians.
It is in the schoolroom that socialists and anarchists are found
nowadays, and that the way is being paved for the approaching
period of decadence for the Latin peoples.</p>
